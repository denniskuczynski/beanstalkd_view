Beanstalkd View
===============
A Sinatra app to view/manage beanstalkd queues that can be embedded in a Rails app similar to what's available in Resque.

Configuration
-------------

To use in a Rails app, include the gem in your Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem beanstalkd_view
```

Otherwise, gem install beanstalkd_view


Use the following environment variable to specify the location of the beanstalk server:

``` ruby
ENV['BEANSTALK_URL'] = 'beanstalk://localhost/'
```

This can be a comma separated list, e.g. 'beanstalk://localhost:11300,beanstalk://localhost:11400'

Embedding in a Rails app
------------------------

Add the following to your routes.rb file:

``` ruby
mount BeanstalkdView::Server, :at => "/beanstalkd"
```

(NOTE: You may mount the server at any path, not just /beanstalkd)

You can then browse to your application path to view information about your beanstalkd tubes, i.e.
http://127.0.0.1:3000/beanstalkd

If you wish to authenticate the mounted app with Devise, it would look something like:

``` ruby
devise_for :admin_users, ActiveAdmin::Devise.config

match('/beanstalkd/admin/login' => redirect('/admin/login'))
authenticate :admin_user do
  mount BeanstalkdView::Server, at: "/beanstalkd"
end
```

Running from the command line
------------------------

Run the beanstalkd_view executable, e.g.

beanstalkd_view

or from a Rails app:

bundle exec beanstalkd_view

(This will use the vegas gem to launch the Sinatra app on an available port.)

Alternatively, a Rackup file is provided.  To use: cd into the beanstalkd_view directory and execute:

rackup

Building the front-end Javascript
------------------------

This project uses Grunt (http://gruntjs.com/) to manage javascript linting, concatenation, and minification.

For development, install Grunt as specified on the Grunt website.  Then execute

```ruby
grunt
```

from the command line after modifying any javascript or css files.  The output files will be placed in the lib/beanstalkd_view/resources directory.

Running the tests
------------------------
There are 3 variants of RSpec tests.
* Without beanstalkd running, just execute: rspec spec
* Without 1 instance of beanstalkd running (default port), execute: rspec spec --tag requires_beanstalkd
* Without 2 instances of beanstalkd running (ports 11300 and 11400), execute: rspec spec --tag requires_two_beanstalkd
